### Step 1: Download

#### Option 1: via the command line  
`git clone https://github.com/vahuto/gluo-theme-nylas.git ~/.nylas/packages/gluo-theme-nylas`

**Note:** _Be sure to clone the repo as `gluo-theme-nylas` or else images referenced in the CSS won't be found._

### Step 2: Install
Open the Nylas N1 Preferences panel with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> or `Nylas N1 > Preferences` and choose `Install a themeâ€¦` from the `Select Theme` dropdown.

### Step 3: Activate
Select the `gluo-theme-nylas` folder and press `Open`. N1 will make a copy of the theme files into your `.nylas/packages` directory, notify you that the theme has been installed, and open it a new Finder window.

If you need to get back to the package files, they're located at `/Users/<yourUsername>/.nylas/packages/gluo-theme-nylas`. Either use Terminal or you can open a Finder window and press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> and paste the path in, replacing `<yourUsername>` with your username.
